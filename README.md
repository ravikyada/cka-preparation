# CKA Preparation Guide

Welcome! This repository is designed to help you prepare effectively for the **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)** exam.

The guiding principles of this repo:

- command-first learning
- practical, scenario‑based explanations
- simple wording, strong concepts
- optimized for quick revision
- fully original content

The CKA exam is hands‑on — you work directly in Kubernetes clusters with no multiple‑choice questions. This guide prepares you exactly for that style of exam.
